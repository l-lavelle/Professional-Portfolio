      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Certified Athletic Trainer with 4 years of experience in the
        healthcare field and 5 years of research experience throughout
        collegiate studies. I went to Saginaw Valley State University for my
        undergraduate degree and Western Michigan University for my masters. I
        worked as an Athletic Trainer at local high school during my time at
        Western. After graudation when the pandemic ensued, I started job at ATI
        Physical Therapy as sporting events were on hold. I got to meet and work
        with different population of people and injuries. <br /><br />
        My interest in research and data lead me to complete data analytics
        courses though Cousera (online learning platform) while working on
        projects to implement and grow my skillset. During this time, I decided
        that I wanted to change careers and dive into the techonology field. I'm
        currently taking a full stack bootcamp through MSU to expand my skills
        while working at Central Transport as pricing analyst. <br /><br />
        Outside of the professional arena I like finding and cooking new recipes
        to try different foods and expand my platte. I love reading books and
        learning about peoples experinces.
